            <p>
                My daughter learned to make these cookies at a baking camp at Zingermanns and has tweaked the recipe to fit the taste buds of her siblings.  They are extremely sugary so the salt helps to balance it.  Note, these cookies are best eaten very quickly.

            <p>
                This is a tried-and-tested recipe that I have used numerous times for making the perfect chocolate chip banana bread! Not only does it help utilize the bananas that have slowly overripened at the back of the fridge, it ends up creating an incredibly delicious, and relatively healthy, dessert. 
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>Cooking spray</li>

                <li>1/2 cup semisweet chocolate chips</li>
            </ul>

                <li>Bake bread until a tester inserted into the center comes out clean, about 1 hour. Let cool 10 minutes in pan, then invert onto a wire rack and let cool completely.</li>

            <p>Swedish pancakes are thin, crepe-like pancakes that are served with lingonberry jam and butter. They are traditionally served for breakfast, but are also great for lunch or dinner. They are a staple of the Swedish diet and are often served at holidays and celebrations.</p>

            <h3>Recipe Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Butter</li>
                <li>Sugar</li>
                <li>Eggs</li>
                <li>Vanilla</li>
                <li>Milk</li>
                <li>Water</li>
                <li>Salt</li>
                <li>Flour</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Recipe Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Combine all ingredients in a blender and blend until completely smooth.Transfer to the refrigerator to rest for at least 2 hours or up to 2 days.</li>
                <li>Preheat the oven to 200 degrees if you plan to eat the pannkakor right away.  Heat a 10 inch nonstick skillet over medium heat.  Stir the batter briefly to recombine. Brush skillet with melted butter.  Pick the skillet up off of the burner and quickly add 1/4 cup of batter. Immediately begin swirling the batter around the skillet so that it coats the bottom of the pan.  Continue swirling until the batter is just set.  Return skillet to the burner. Cook until the pancake is golden brown in spots on the bottom, about 30 seconds. Use a thin spatula to loosen the pancake, flip it over continue to cook on the other side for about 30 seconds.  Transfer to a plate. Cover with foil and transfer to oven to keep warm and repeat with remaining batter, wiping out skillet in between pancakes with paper towel as needed.</li>
                <li>Serve with lingonberry jam and butter or other desired toppings and/or fillings.</li>
            </ol>

            <p>I learnt how to cook Coca-Cola chicken wings from my mother, and I've since tweaked her recipe to better suit my family's palate, making it less sweet.

                <li>Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and marinate the chicken wings for 1 hour.</li>
                <li>Put the right amount of oil in the pot, and put the marinated chicken wings into the pot and fry it until golden brown on both sides.</li>
                <li>After fry the chicken wings until golden brown on both sides, then pour a can of coke into the pan and bring to a boil.</li>
